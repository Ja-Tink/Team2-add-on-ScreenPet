## Working on an Issue

1. Always comment on the issue to let others know you’re working on it (or ask to be assigned).
2. Discuss any clarifications needed before you begin coding.

## Coding Guidelines

1. **Code Style*: While we ourselves don't have a strict style set up for this project (yet), it's in your best interest to follow a consistent style when writing code.
2. **Comments**: Write clear comments (!!) for complex logic.
3. **Naming**: Always remember to use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
4. **Modularity**: Keep functions and modules focused; avoid large, monolithic files.
5. **Browser Compatibility**: Keep in mind that this is a browser extension. Minimize reliance on features not widely supported by major browsers.

## Commit Messages 

Try to keep to a style such as [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

**feat**: A new feature
**fix**: A bug fix
**docs**: Documentation-only changes
**style**: Code style (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
**refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
**test**: Adding or correcting tests
*etc.*
