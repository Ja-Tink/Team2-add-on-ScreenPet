# Virtual Pet Extension

The Virtual Pet extension is an interactive browser extension that enables user to take care of a digital pet without wasting their time when surfing on internet. The pet has different moods and requires regular feeding to stay happy. If left unfed for too long, it will become hungry again automatically.

## Why does user want this?

- Easy to Use: Users just need to click a button to feed the pet and keep it happy. It won't take much time for user to interact with this pet.
