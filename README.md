# Virtual Pet Extension

## Overview
The Virtual Pet extension is an interactive Firefox browser extension where the user can take care of a digital pet. Keep your pet happy by not letting it get too hungry, but don't overfeed it either!

The main goals and features currently planned are:

Selecting from two pets and food types

Pet grows when fed (clicks) and shrinks if ignored

Pet persists across pages in a single browser session

Reset option for starting over

**Note**: The petâ€™s state is not saved if the browser is closed.

## Installing the Virtual Pet
